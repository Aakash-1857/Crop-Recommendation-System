## üî¨ About the Model

- **Algorithm**: **Random Forest** was chosen for its high accuracy and robustness in handling classification tasks.
- **Features Used**: The model is trained on the following seven parameters:
    - **N**: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
    - **P**: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
    - **K**: Ratio of Potassium content in soil
    - **Temperature**: Temperature in degrees Celsius
    - **Humidity**: Relative humidity in %
    - **pH**: pH value of the soil
    - **Rainfall**: Rainfall in mm
